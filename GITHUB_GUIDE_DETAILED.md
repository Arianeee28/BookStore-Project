3. To edit existing files, click the file and then click the pencil icon
4. Always add clear commit messages describing your changes
5. Use the preview tab when editing markdown files
6. Keep each upload focused on the specific feature you're implementing

## Common Issues and Solutions:
1. Wrong branch selected:
   - Always check the branch indicator before uploading
   - You can switch branches using the branch dropdown

2. File conflicts:
   - If GitHub shows conflicts, use the web editor to resolve them
   - Choose which changes to keep or combine them manually

3. Large files:
   - Upload large files (like images) in smaller batches
   - Ensure images are optimized before uploading

4. Navigation:
   - Use breadcrumbs at the top to navigate between folders
   - Use the "Go to file" button to quickly find files
